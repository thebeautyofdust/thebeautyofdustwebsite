<p dir="ltr"><span>She said&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;They said...&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And she wept</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Her civil tears her muted refrain -&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This battle was not</span><span>why she came</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She came&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the same way he did</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Their stories interconnected&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>By the Spirit to Christ&rsquo;s servanthood</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Yet</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She was not welcome</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A fact even her welcomers did not know</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>They were authentic, they were hospitable</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There was nothing they did not do for a </span><span>female</span></p>
</Section>
<Section>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He</span><span>was a leader though</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>History had taught them that</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And maybe he was</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Maybe not</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But he appeared to be</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Unlike she</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In all her femininity</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And emotional unpredictability</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She could lead - with sparkling cultural shackles in place</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And a customised interface</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Of men, to guide and protect</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Relieving her of a load, a cross</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>That was not her concern</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And nor could she learn</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To be one with such spiritual authority</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It was not in her body</span></p>
</Section>
<Section>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There were some with deep conviction</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though, the question could still at least be posed</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Is this something you, unconsciously,</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">actually<span>want</span><span> to know that you &lsquo;know&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But there were many who naively toed the line</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really affect me, ya know, so it&rsquo;s fine...&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Is it really a big deal for the Church&rsquo;s success?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And little lonely she</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On the tomato soaked soap box</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Took a controlled breath</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And said&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Yes, it is a big deal</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Yes, it does affect you</span></p>
</Section>
<Section>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Your sisters, your daughters</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>God&rsquo;s calling them too</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To a people who live with walls broken down</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And hands that lift people up from the stench of the ground</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Check Luke, check Paul</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And not just a verse or a line</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>See the ministry of Jesus</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Subverting cultural patriarchy time after time</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Scriptures breath a way for the Church</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Where women and men alike are called to serve</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To prophesy, to preach, to love, and to lead</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To make disciples, baptise, confess, forgive, to feed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She said</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But they said&hellip;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And she wept</span></p>
</Section>
<Section>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Again</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Just another emotional</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Fragile</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Woman</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And then&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She picked up her staff</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For her next task</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Was no less of a feat</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Simply because of the red fruit stains on her feet</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She stays</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She works</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Because Christ asked her to</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>And when she questioned Him</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He said, &ldquo;What, then, shall you do?&rdquo;</span></p>
</Section>
<Section>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The he leader leads on, and often he leads well</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Her faithfulness is credited to her as disobedience or ignorance&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Or as her head beginning to swell</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>How many women do they need to be able to see</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Jesus send</span><span><br /></span><span>In communion with men</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To serve in ministry</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To allow to kneel and learn at His Rabbi feet</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To acknowledge as equal and not secondary?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>How many?!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Too many</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Says she.</span></p>
